Waste Seeker is a 2D platformer centered around an earth long abandoned by humanity due to the world's oceans drying up. The only inhabitants on this forsakened planet are the descendants of those who were unlucky enough to be stranded from the rest of humanity. The main character, Kuzu, is from the last defiled city on the planet looking for a way out but must not only face the world's harsh conditions but also those who want her dead.
